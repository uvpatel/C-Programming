int main(){
    // Functions:
    /*
    
    Functions are use for solve probelem and we can break logic of code into the chunks.
    
    Thumb Rule: If any probelem which are used in the code more than use function for solving that perticular problem.
    
    About Function:
        There are mainly in Functions geanraly devide into three part:

        1) Function  Prototype(declaration). We are write Functions with Parameters.


        2) Function  defination : we are write logic for function. in defination part. what will function do. 


        3) Function call: 
        Function call is essential because we put arguments in this code and function logic will apply.


        Parameters: Formal Parameters
        Arguments: Actual Parameters

        Main→calling function
        User defined fucnt→ called function

        Step-1 function declaration
        Step-2 int main() → call the function
        Step-3 function definition

        Return type→ What value function is returning (int, float, char, double, void)

        When call the funct in main→ it will find the definition→ then it match the
        definition with declaration (return type, funct name, parameters)→if match
        trun the funct→Closes braces, control return to the main


        We can't write function defination in main function we can write prototype and function call . why because:
        function's bydefualt value is int so we have to take care of it.

        It takes int as an implicit return type,
        if we don’t declare funct with char
