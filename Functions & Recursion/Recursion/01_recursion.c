    /*What is a Recusion: 
    -> Recusion is phenomena which occured when function calling itself.
    
    Recusion function is the one type of function we use in programming for doing reptive task.

    in recursion base condition is one of the most important part in recursive function.


    Type of Recursion: 
    1)Direct Recusion:
        -> Function calls itself directly.
    2)indirect:
    -> A function calls another function,which eventually calls the first one again.

    3)Tail Recusion:
    The recursive call is the last statement in the function.

    it can be optimized by the compiler. 

    4) Head Recursion:
    The recusive call happens before any other operations.

    5) Tree Recursion:
    A function calls itself more than once.

    6)Nested Recursion: 
    A recursion function is called inside another recursive call.
