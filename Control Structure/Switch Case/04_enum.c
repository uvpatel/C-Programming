    Facts about enum:
        1. Two enum names can have same value.
        2. If we do not explicitly assign values to enum names, the compiler by default assigns
        values starting from 0.
        3. We can assign values to some name in any order. All unassigned names get value as
        value of previous name plus one.
        4. The value assigned to enum names must be some integral constant, i.e., the value
        must be in range from minimum possible integer value to maximum possible integer
        value.
        5. All enum constants must be unique in their scope.
